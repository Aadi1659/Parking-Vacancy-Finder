To run the app, you will need:
STREAMLIT, TENSORFLOW, OPEN-CV, MATPLOTLIB, SCIKIT-IMAGE

<ol>
  <li>Use the image generator file to generate the images.</li>
  <li>Train the images using the train file</li>
  <li>Evaluate the images using the evaluate file.</li>
  <li>TYPE: streamlit run myapp.py to run the app.</li>
</ol>
